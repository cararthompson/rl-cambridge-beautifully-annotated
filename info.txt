# Title ----
Beautifully annotated: enhancing your ggplots with text

# Abstract ----
Applying design principles to the text in our graphs, and making text an integral part of the visualisation, can make all the difference between a busy plot and a plot which communicates a clear story.
In this session, we will explore:
- how to be less dependent on annotations (I know... trust me!)
- how to use colors and fonts to draw attention to key elements in annotations
- how to format text on the fly to change fonts, colors, alignments and text sizes using `{ggtext}`
- how to add arrows to your plots to highlight key data points or important patterns
- a few useful packages and ggplot tricks when it comes to annotations
Attendees are welcome to bring along one of their own plots to discuss during the Q&A session for some live feedback. 



Talk plan

# Intro

## Penguin demo using colours to help

## Text hierarchy 

## Why do this in R rather than use something like Figma? 

# Let's get coding

## Basic bar plot, adding colours to highlight vit c vs orange

## Text hierarchy through theme

Not the focus of this talk, so going to do a "here's one I built earlier", but if you want to find out more about that, this is the theme I built in an 8 minute talk for the NHS-R conference last year. 

## Bar plot to demo alignment and colour of labels
- Remove clutter, extreme version go theme_void() and it still works; tailer to your audience!
- Watch out for transparency / colours affecting accessibility (point to websites to check this)

## Scatter plot to show more of the same + arrows 

### Add geomtextpath

### Add gghighlight
